#Openlitespeed rules for setting up default "/admin/" folder as rickroll hackers and only allow whitelisted IPs to access the admin folder "/admin/"

#How to use:
# This file should be in the document root for the site. Meaning in the directory where these subfolders exists and not inside the subfolders.
# so if path to "/admin/" folder is "~Username/public_html/admin" then this file should be reside or the contents should be in the top of the file "~Username/public_html/.htaccess"

#Dynamically Rewrite to HTTPS without WWW
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.*)$
RewriteRule (.*) https://%1/$1 [R=301,L]
